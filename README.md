## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned a lot this challenge, and in getting prepared and organizing myself for it. I learned a lot about CSS grid, and I implemented it on a project for the first time here. I absolutely LOVE it, and I can't wait to keep using it. It works extremely well for laying out a project. It works really well with flexbox as well, and I'm glad that I learned to use it before starting to work on this project.

I also learned how to create an accordion with JavaScript for this project. It's my first time creating one, and surprisingly, it wasn't as difficult as I was expecting it might be. That being said, there are definitely a few ways I can improve on it.

### Continued development

My JavaScript accordion works, but it isn't perfect. I would like to figure out why the transition isn't taking effect when the accordion closes, and once I figure it out, I'll implement it here.

I also need to continue to work on my responsive design. Although I'm improving, there are so many ways that I can keep getting better. I plan on continuing to learn as much as I can about HTML, CSS and JavaScript as I continue to build these frontend mentor projects and my hope is that I will continue to learn and improve consistently.
